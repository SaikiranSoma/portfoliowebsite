Here is my portfolio project made using html css javascript.
Building this website was an incredible learning experience
for me, and I am grateful for the opportunity to challenge myself and 
expand my knowledge. I am excited to continue growing as a web developer and take on new projects in the future.
Looking forward to add new stuff as I learn them...
